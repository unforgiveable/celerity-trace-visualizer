# Installing Plugins:

Only .dlls in the Assets/Plugins folder get loaded!
First install the plugin using the NuGet package manager in Visual Studio.
The required files will be in the [UnityProject]/Packages folder.
Copy only the "netstandard2.1"/"netstandard2.0" (whichever one is available, if both just the newer one) version folders to the Assets/Plugins folder.
Make sure to delete the "ref" folder as well!
After that let the unity project rebuild.
Then go to Edit->Preferences->External Tools and click "Regenerate Project Files".
(This might not be available if the project has compiler errors - temporarily remove the files that cause the errors from the project to fix this!)
And done! Now the assemblies should show up as references in Visual Studio as well.
